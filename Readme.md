# Conway's game of life
This is a small Conway's game of life made in go with SDL2. This is my first go program and it was made to learn go.

## How to play
Click anywhere in the grid to add a cell. White cell denote dead and black cell denote alive.

Click the play button to start the game. To control the speed, drag the slider.

Press "C" to clear the grid and "R" to randomize the whole grid.
